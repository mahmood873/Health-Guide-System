# Health-Guide-System
We are all aware that technology is advancing at a rapid pace, and that many areas of our everyday life will be digitalized in the near future. One of the scenarios that has grabbed my interest in working on is the global medical system. Patients in wealthier countries have access to user-friendly systems, yet they cannot just go to whatever health organisation they want. Furthermore, patients in Afghanistan have access to only a few international websites that give information or counselling. Our online medical system is simple, informative, and easy to use for patients.
Patients will be allowed to use and visit all of their preferred legitimate medical institutions. Apart from the patients, the Afghan government will have no trouble registering all doctors, hospitals, and medical stores that adhere to the rules.


# Primary Goals
The Ministry of Health and Public Welfare will have access to a single system that will keep track of all doctors, medical clinics, hospitals, and medical stores that have registered with them; the rest can be banned or restricted.
Patients can utilise the system to schedule an appointment online, and then use the address system to go directly to the location where they scheduled the appointment, saving time.
The technology will assist patients outside of Afghanistan in neighbouring countries by making it easier for them to find preferred doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies. This exercise will save a patient valuable time while also benefiting them financially.

# Main Functionalities
If all Ministry of Public Health Afghanistan users, including doctors and central database controllers, use this app, they will have a very pleasant user experience, and all doctors, clinics, and medical stores can register through their own accounts with the Ministry of Public Health's approval, and after their accounts are approved according to MOPH's laws and regulations, they can work freely in the health sector. In addition, all unlicensed doctors, clinics, and medical stores must register in the system; if any do not, the MOPH might take serious action against them based on patient complaints or a survey undertaken by the MOPH. 
Patients can make appointments with a preferred expert from Afghanistan's far-flung areas, but they must be given all information about the doctors and clinical hospitals. They can make appointments with specialists in neighbouring countries who are not in Afghanistan; patients must be given all information on the doctors and clinical hospitals.
